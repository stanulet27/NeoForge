        Dialogue: "Ah, gather 'round and hear the tale of young Zoey, born into a
          noble family where the halls were adorned with fine tapestries and the
          air was filled with the scent of polished wood and aged parchment. Though
          zier upbringing was one of privilege and comfort, Zoey's heart yearned
          for something more than the duties of nobility. Zey spent hours in the
          castle\u2019s forge, watching the blacksmiths shape metal with a combination
          of strength and precision. It was there, amidst the heat and the sparks,
          that Zoey discovered zier true calling, much to the surprise of zier family"
