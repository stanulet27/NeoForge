        Dialogue: "Well, our king is Leoric the Strong. They say he once wrestled
          a bear with his bare hands! Of course, he\u2019s not the brightest star
          in the sky, but Queen Elara more than makes up for it with her sharp mind.
          Did you know she\u2019s the one who secretly negotiates all our treaties?"
