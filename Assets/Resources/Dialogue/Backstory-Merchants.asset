        Dialogue: "Ah, let me tell you the tale of young Zoey, born into a bustling
          merchant family where the clink of coins and the hum of trade were the
          rhythms of daily life. From an early age, zey accompanied zier parents
          to markets, observing the art of negotiation and the value of quality goods.
          Zoey\u2019s keen eye for detail and a knack for understanding what people
          desired set zem apart even as a child. However, even then it was clear
          that while the family dealt in goods, Zoey's heart was drawn to the craftsmanship
          behind those goods, setting the stage for the remarkable journey that lay
          ahead."
