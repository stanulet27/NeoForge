        Dialogue: "Ah, let me tell you the tale of young Zoey, born into a family
          where the sound of hammer on anvil was the music of daily life. From a
          tender age, zey watched zier parents work the forge, their skilled hands
          shaping metal with a precision that seemed like magic. Zoey\u2019s eyes
          would light up with fascination as zey learned the secrets of the trade,
          bit by bit, under the careful guidance of zier family. As zey grew, it
          was clear to all that the fire of the forge burned brightly in zier heart,
          setting the stage for the remarkable journey that lay ahead."
