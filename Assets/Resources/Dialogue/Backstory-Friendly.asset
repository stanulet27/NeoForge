        Dialogue: For, in the prime of youth, Zoey earned an apprenticeship and began
          zier journey as a blacksmith. Known for zier friendly demeanor, Zoey turned
          zier forge into a gathering place where laughter and stories flowed as
          freely as the sparks. Zey had a knack for making each customer feel like
          an old friend, often brewing a pot of tea to share while discussing their
          needs. Over the years, Zoey's warmth and exceptional skill made zem a beloved
          figure in the region, where people came not just for zier craftsmanship
          but for the joy of zier company.
